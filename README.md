  <h2>💻 Python Development Environments</h2>

  <h3>📘 Jupyter Notebook</h3>
  <p>
    Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's widely used in Data Science and Machine Learning.
  </p>

  <h3>🟢 IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)</h3>
  <p>
    IDLE is Python’s built-in IDE that comes pre-installed with Python. It provides a simple interface for writing and running Python code, best for beginners learning the basics of Python programming.

  <h2>🧠 Python Data Types</h2>
  <p>Python supports the following basic data types:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>int</strong> – Integer numbers (e.g., 5, -3, 100)</li>
    <li><strong>float</strong> – Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)</li>
    <li><strong>str</strong> – Strings/Text (e.g., "Hello", 'Python')</li>
    <li><strong>bool</strong> – Boolean values (True or False)</li>
    <li><strong>list</strong> – Ordered, mutable collection (e.g., [1, 2, 3])</li>
    <li><strong>tuple</strong> – Ordered, immutable collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3))</li>
    <li><strong>dict</strong> – Key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "John", "age": 30})</li>
    <li><strong>set</strong> – Unordered collection of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3})</li>
  </ul>
